# 🎲 Tenzies Game (React)

A simple and fun dice game built with **React** as a practice project.  
Roll until all the dice show the same number. Click on a die to "freeze" it so it doesn't roll on the next turn.

💡 What I Learned
	•	Managing arrays of state (dice)
	•	Mapping and updating state immutably
	•	Conditional styling (active/frozen dice)
	•	Game logic (check if all values match and are held)
	•	Creating confetti effects using a React library
